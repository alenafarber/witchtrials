England,1645,"<p>Compared to some of the other countries on this map, England had relatively few witch trials. In large part, this was because English courts did not employ torture in ordinary witchcraft trials, meaning there were fewer accusations. </p>
<p>However, the Essex region of England had a significant uptick in witch trials in the 1640s. This spike can be attributed to Matthew Hopkins, the ""Witch Finder Generall.""</p>
<p>Admittedly, during Hopkins's operation, the assizes were not in session, so the trials he affected directly are not seen on this chart. Nevertheless, Hopkins did introduce Continental conceptions of witchcraft to England and increased usage of ""confessions,"" which led to more trials even in the normal courts.</p>","Mitchell (March 20, 2017)"
France,1585,"<p>France had a significant increase in witch trials from the 1580s to the 1600s. There's no explicitly stated reason for why this was, but based on some circumstantial evidence, my explanation is as follows.</p>
<p>In the Early Modern period, witch trials often occurred in times of significant social unrest. One major source of social unrest was the Reformation, which led to religious and civil discontent. France, as a strong Catholic state, was particularly prone to religious conflict.</p>
<p>During the 16th century, France played host to wars and massacres of Protestants. The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in Paris, the last major massacre in the French wars of religion, occurred in 1572, after which the violent decreased somewhat. However, the bloodshed was not definitively ended until the Edict of Nantes in 1598.</p>
<p>Yet while the Edict of Nantes may have granted Protestants new religious and political freedoms, the social tension did not immediately dissipate. It could have instead found an outlet in accusations of witchcraft. This could have occurred either maliciously&mdash;to punish those who did not conform to religious norms&mdash;or unintentionally&mdash;when social tension and lack of understanding led to fear and needless accusations. Either way, Paris in the late 16th century was a hotbed of accusations of witchcraft.</p>","Mitchell (March 22, 2017)"
England,1585,"<p>England had an increase in trials in the 1580s, most likely due to the return of exiles who had fled under Mary Tudor. When these individuals returned from the Continent, they not only brought increased religious diversity (which often led to social unrest), but also Continental ideas and fears of witchcraft. These factors combined to create an increase in accusations of witchcraft in 1580s England.</p>","Mitchell (March 20, 2017)"
Hungary,1720,"<p>The data shown on this map suggest that Hungary had a significant increase in witch trials starting in 1690s. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt. First of all, the data for Hungary is for the entire country, rather than a particular city of jurisdiction, so the numbers could easily be higher than those of the Parlement of Paris or the English Assizes. Second, Hungarian legal records were often entirely lost in the period before 1690, which means that those trials are probably missing from the historical record.</p>
<p>However, even if we take the data at face value, the spikes in trials can mainly be explained by the wars taking place in Hungary at the time. Generally speaking, the end of a major war or uprising tended to usher in a new wave of accusations and a corresponding upturn in trials.</p>",Klaniczay (1990)
Finland,1670,"<p>In 1675-6, Finland experienced its only series of massive witch hunts, which included both an increase in accusations of witchcraft as well as regular mass trials. The effects of these witch hunts can still be seen in the data for next decade. One possible reason for these witch hunts was that the Finnish understanding of witchcraft had changed. In the 1660s, the idea of Diabolism and allyship with Satan was first introduced to Finland, and the trials during the 1670s had a significant increase in accusations of being allied with the devil.</p>",Heikkinen and Kervinen (1990)
